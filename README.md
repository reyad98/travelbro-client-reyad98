This site is about your travel [Travel Monday](https://hospital-info-55fc1.web.app/home).



### `Defination`

To travel from one place to another for different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not travel always for the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value.


### `Purpose`
It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things from travelling. It teaches us to trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides this, there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays in one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous. 

### `Demographics`
In the past, traveling was not easy. People had to travel long distances on foot or horseback. They also traveled in ships and horse-cart. At some places, people used bullock carts, camels, and elephants. In snow-covered countries, people used the sled. Then traveling even a short distance was much bothering and time-consuming.


### `Description`
Travelling is, indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new people and learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us. When we go to a new place all of our senses and instincts  become awake , In such circumstances we can learn new things very easily. Everything seems beautiful and sterling at a new place. Purpose: People travels for different purposes. Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many people also travel for business and employment.

### `Preparation`

Travelling has manifold benefits. It is a part and parcel of our education. Our education and bookish knowledge remain imperfect without traveling. We may read about many places in our history books. If we can visit these places, the study of history becomes interesting. We read about men and things from different parts of the world. By traveling to different parts of the world, we see new people and new things. We can learn much about the manners and customs of those people. In this way, we can gain much knowledge. Consequently, our narrowness of mind disappears.
