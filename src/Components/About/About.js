                Bangladesh has a large population and a wide healthcare delivery network to cater them. But the infrastructure is inefficient and sometime inadequate. The design and inherent integration of the different tiers of healthcare facilities are also inefficient. Moreover, doctors and healthcare facilities are not fairly distributed throughout the country. Modern and sophisticated services are limited to capital city or mostly 3 or 4 big cities. Ensuring equitable access to all healthcare services is a big challenge. Resources and efforts should be ensured to develop trained manpower and their capacity development. Hospitals face the challenges to provide services to chronically ill patients, geriatric and mental health patients, provide modern state of the art facilities equitably as well as handling overcrowding issues at District and Medical College Hospitals.
